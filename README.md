# Sudoku Solver with AI Algorithms

**This project was developed as part of a college course on Intelligent Systems.** It is a Sudoku game and solver that uses AI algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles. The program includes a graphical interface built with Tkinter, and you can select the difficulty level for a new game or use the AI to solve a puzzle. The AI employs techniques such as Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) methods, including AC-3 and backtracking search.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) by selecting one of the options provided. After that, click **New Game**. This will generate a new Sudoku puzzle with varying amounts of pre-filled cells.
3. To start solving the puzzle yourself, click on empty cells and input numbers. Alternatively, click **Solve** to let the AI solve the puzzle automatically.
